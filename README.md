# About
This site attempts to visualise some data about candidates from the 2016 Australian Federal Election, especially to with gender of candidates. The aim is to show how gender is distributed across parties and position on the ballot paper.

# Data
Once nominations are declared (June 10) I will use data from the Australian Electoral Commission. In the mean time, I am using [data from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_Australian_federal_election,_2016).

The raw data is stored in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvBRkeXyamjWkKLjhcS720tBmGuT23CL-KZdGCkGKmk/pubhtml), although that may change.

# Installation
